   <p>Dorothy is an American rock band founded in Los Angeles, California, United States. The band is composed of vocalist Dorothy Martin, drummer Dylan Howard, guitarist DJ Black and bassist Gregg Cash. They released their first project, a self-titled EP, in 2014. Rolling Stone deemed them "a [band] you need to know," and named them #14 on their 50 Best New Artists of 2014 list.[1][2]</p>
